# Code and data for Juechems et al (2019) A network for computing value equilibrium in the human medial prefrontal cortex. Neuron.

# Notes
This repo provides the data and code to reproduce some of the figure panels. I also provide the source code for the experiment, but note that the size of the displayed objects may differ greatly across devices and was optimized for the scanning computer. You will need PsychToolbox to run the experiment. All code written for MATLAB. 
If you find any bugs or something is missing/does not run on your system, do please let me know so I can correct it.


# NB
Over the coming days (before 30/01/2019) I will be making some changes to make the code more user-friendly, add more comments, and correct some bugs that arise when switching between operating systems and MATLAB versions. If you see this before the end of January, make sure to check back in February 2019 for a more accessible code base.
