# Notes

## Experiment
You can run the experiment by adding the code folder to your path and then running either
exp_main_all(subject_nr,0) -- this will run the training block and display instructions (in Spanish)
or
exp_main_all(subject_nr,1) -- this will start the full experiment with scanner timings

When the experiment starts, you need to press space to start and send the "trigger" by pressing S

## Code
The most important files start with paper_ for example paper_log_regression will run the logistic regressions of behaviour.

## Data
All data is in a single data structure, with fields identifying the variables recorded (and those computed for convenience).
